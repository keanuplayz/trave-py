# Basic imports:
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

# Cog class:
class Example(commands.Cog):

#   Forgot what this does, add it:
    def __init__(self, client):
        self.client = client

#   This is an event:
    @commands.Cog.listener()
    async def on_ready(self):
        print('This will be printed to the console.')

#   This is a command:
    @commands.command()
    async def ping(self, ctx):
        await ctx.send("pong nigga")

# This always needs to be at the end of a cog file:
def setup(client):
    client.add_cog(Example(client))
